# GoreeCloud Download Manager Extension — Planned Features

> **Authority:** Repository-native preserved plan for the former Firefox Download Manager Extension component.  
> **Current component boundary:** The historical roadmap names the former `extensions/download-manager/` path in the Firefox extensions monorepo, but that component is not present on the current `firefox-addons` default branch as of 2026-09-27. This record preserves planned obligations without recreating retired/missing source or claiming current runtime availability.

Active roadmap control • As of September 8, 2026
Purpose
This document is the Drive-side feature roadmap control for GoreeCloud Download Manager Extension. It records current planned and recommended feature work without replacing the authoritative project record, repository implementation evidence, release gates, or GoreeCloud Tasks Management.
Roadmap
Maintenance and synchronization
This roadmap and the corresponding repository FEATURE-ROADMAP.md must remain materially synchronized with one another and with the authoritative project or service record. Update both copies whenever feature scope, priority, dependency, implementation status, cancellation, supersession, recommendation, or verification state materially changes.
No feature may be represented as complete or Stable solely because it appears in this roadmap. Completion and lifecycle claims require the applicable authoritative implementation, validation, review, release, and production evidence.
Reconciliation rule
At each material feature change, reconcile this roadmap against the current authoritative project record, repository implementation state, applicable platform-system requirements, and GoreeCloud Tasks Management. Missing obligations, stale status, duplicated work, roadmap drift, or undocumented disposition changes are defects to correct.

## Repository-native maintenance

Google Drive synchronization is retired. Any future reintroduction of a Firefox Download Manager component requires an explicit repository decision, current source, current validation, and lifecycle evidence.
